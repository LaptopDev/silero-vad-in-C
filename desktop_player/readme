 Multiple files go together with this. There is the 
key bindings, which are found in 
  the DWM configuration file. 
  and the xbindkeysrc file.
And there are a couple of 
scripts, 
  one of them being a shell script, 
  another being another shell script. 
  And finally, there is a plugin script for MPV, 
    which enables the persistence of a background playing audio file without its closure, unless, of course, the process is killed.



 Some other things that could be good that I still haven't done are related to the overlay, 
to show transcription snippet on the screen representing the current playback position in the transcribed audio file being played back.

 Also, "Dunstify" message should do something. Not sure what, maybe the notification should
   display the file name played.
 I was thinking maybe displaying realtime file positional information but that's probably going to best be done with a second ./overlay file
