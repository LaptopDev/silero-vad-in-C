 Multiple files go together with this. There is the 
key bindings, which are found in 
  the DWM configuration file. 
  and the xbindkeysrc file.
And there are a couple of 
scripts, 
  one of them being a shell script, 
  another being another shell script. 
  And finally, there is a plugin script for MPV, 
    which enables the persistence of a background playing audio file without its closure, unless, of course, the process is killed.
